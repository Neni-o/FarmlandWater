# ðŸŒ±ðŸ’§â€‹ Farmland Water

Farmland Water is a Minecraft Forge mod that lets players walk across water blocks that are horizontally adjacent to farmland, provided there is air above the water. This allows moving around fields quickly without trampling crops. The feature can be toggled with the gamerule:

```
/gamerule FarmlandWater <true|false>
```

This mod pairs well with my other mod [AutoSow](https://github.com/Neni-o/AutoSow).
